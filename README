Project Ada

Team: Paul BENETEAU
      Maxime MEHIO

Goal: use an accelerometer as a mouse

Devices: Board STM32F429 Discovery and Ch Robotics UM6 sensor

The official UM6 documentation (http://www.chrobotics.com/docs/UM6_datasheet.pdf)

How the project is built:
    The STM32F429 Discovery board is connected using serial to the computer and the
    sensor. The UM6 sensor has two modes: Broadcast and Listen
    Listen mode only sends data when it is requested, Broadcast mode in the over hand
    sends data with a certain frequency. The sensor can be configured to send only certain
    types of data, modify its frequency, etc ...
    
    Our focus was therefore to write a configuration to the sensor and make it permanent
    using FLASH_COMMIT (that writes inner registers of the sensor).
    Then we only need to parse the data received.

Project made using GPS IDE and the code provided by AdaCore for STM32F429 Discovery Boards.
